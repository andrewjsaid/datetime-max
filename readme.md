There's really no point to this project.

I really just wanted to see if I could have a DateTimeOffset object which 
had a value higher than the max, and it kinda spun out of control, and I
want somewhere to store the code which rewrites parts of methods.

```
DateTime: 08/11/14614 13:24:02
DateTimeOffset: 08/11/14614 13:24:02 +00:00
```
